              E-Formula Ashwa Riders was founded in 2022 by a group of passionate
              engineering students who shared a common dream: to build the future
              of electric racing. What started as a small team of 15 members has
              grown into a dynamic organization of over 50 dedicated individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our journey began with a simple yet ambitious goal - to design and
              build an electric formula car that could compete with the best teams
              in the world. Through countless hours of design, testing, and
              iteration, we've created vehicles that not only perform on the track
              but also showcase the potential of sustainable racing technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we're proud to be one of the most innovative Formula Student
              teams, consistently pushing the boundaries of what's possible in
              electric vehicle design and performance.
